# RICs_RIPs
An implementation of RICs_RIPs Algorithm in MoonScript. The RICs_RIPs Algorithm is a brilliant aproach to generate unrestricted and restricted integer compositions and integer partitions. 

It was proposed by John Douglas Opdyke on his papper "A Unified Approach to Algorithms Generating Unrestricted and Restricted Integer Compositions and Integer Partitions" (full text at http://bit.ly/1Mmgqg9).

It's my first MoonScript code and GitHub submission, so I hope you don't mind it's a little rough yet.
